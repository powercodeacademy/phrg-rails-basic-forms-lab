<h1>Welcome to the Puppy Adoption Site</h1>

<%= link_to "Click Here To List A Puppy", puppy_path %>

<!--
  TODO: Create your homepage here!

  This page should:
  - Welcome visitors to the Puppy Adoption Site
  - Include a link to the new puppy form
  - The link should go to '/new' and should have the text "Click Here To List A Puppy"

  Hint: Use Rails link_to helper
